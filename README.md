# Inventory Management System with Demand Forecasting (NOTE: Updated project is in master branch not in default branch)
This project is a smart, web-based Inventory Management System developed for Vambsk Fabs, designed to streamline stock control and predict future product demand using Machine Learning. Built using Django (backend), MySQL (database), and JavaScript (frontend), the system offers an efficient and scalable solution for real-time inventory tracking and demand forecasting.

The key highlight of this system is its integration with the ARIMA algorithm, which analyzes historical sales data to forecast product demand. This helps in preventing both stockouts and overstocking, ensuring optimized restocking and improved supply chain efficiency.

Core Features:
Role-based login system for managers and staff

Real-time inventory tracking with stock alerts

Demand forecasting using ARIMA for weekly sales prediction

Interactive dashboards with weekly sales charts and item-wise breakdown

Auto-generated PDF reports for inventory trends and analytics

Easy-to-use interface for managing product stock, sales, and tasks

The system is suitable for businesses aiming to shift from reactive to predictive inventory control. It helps decision-makers plan smarter, reduce waste, and maintain better control over their supply chain.
